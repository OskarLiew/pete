In **density-based [[Clustering]]** clusters are defines as areas of higher density than the remainder of the dataset. Examples in sparse areas - that are required to separate the clusters - are considered noise and border points. The most common density-based clustering algorithm is [[DBSCAN]].

## Advantages

- Can create clusters of arbitrary shape
- Not affected by outliers

## Drawbacks

- Expects density drop to detect cluster borders
- Does not assign outliers
