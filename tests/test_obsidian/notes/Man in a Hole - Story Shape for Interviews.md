The simplest of the story shapes to use during recuitment interviews

1. Anchor the story on your status and responsibilities on a team by using terms from the job description
2. Layer in conflict like challenges and obstacles. Lay it on thick ;)
3. Describe how you climbed out of the situation

The story has a U-shape and the magnitude of the U signals to the interviewer everything they need to know about your level. Where the U starts tells the interviewer which levels you operated at and what kind of impact to expect if you join. How far you dipped shows the interviewer what the size of the problems you can deal with are. Do not end on perfect success, because that might raise suspicions that you are exaggerating.
